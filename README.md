**ExerciseTracker**

    ExerciseTracker is a full stack web application developed in the MERN stack. Concerns are separated using 
    the Model-View-Controller design. A user interacts with the front end React app to log their exercises.
    User input is then passed to the backend, that logs their input into MongoDB. Different pages are acceessed
    via different endpoints in Express.
